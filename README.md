## Projects


**Financial Distress Prediction**

Bankruptcy represents a significant and undesirable event within the economic landscape, bearing lasting negative consequences that reverberate across various sectors. Its impacts extend beyond immediate stakeholders to encompass business owners, shareholders, investors, policymakers, employees, and governmental entities. The global reverberations of the Lehman Brothers' financial crisis of 2008 serve as a poignant reminder of the far-reaching ramifications of such events.

In the research endeavors, a comprehensive methodological approach has been undertaken to address financial distress, encompassing both bankruptcy and credit scoring considerations. The methodology incorporates strategies tailored to mitigate challenges inherent in bankruptcy datasets, including issues such as high dimensionality, class imbalance, and missing values. To tackle these complexities, advanced computational techniques, including but not limited to improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA), have been employed. A range of deep learning and machine learning algorithms have been employed to develop models with optimal performance in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Furthermore, techniques have been utilized to address high dimensionality and imbalance within the datasets, facilitating comprehensive comparisons.

To address financial distress, advanced computational techniques like PSO and GA are employed, mitigating challenges in bankruptcy datasets such as high dimensionality and class imbalance. **The Effect of Imbalanced Data and Parameter Selection via Genetic Algorithm Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for Financial Distress Prediction**
